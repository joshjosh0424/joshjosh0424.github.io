    The purpose of the banking app project was to get a working MERN project that allowed for specific users to have different options within the project depending on their role. At a high level the banking app is just as you'd expect. An app to track your finances within different accounts, as well as allowing for transfering, depositing, and withdrawing from said accounts.
