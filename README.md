<h3><a href="./BankingApp" >Banking App</a></h3>

  <p>
    This banking app does all the basic functions, withdrawing, transfers, depositing. It has a authentication system for login purposes. The hardest part in the assignment and most others was the sessions. Being able to store that ID and keep certain pages and information hidden depending on the ID was difficult. Took effort from everyone in the group to get that running. Overall the UI looks good, functions well, and was a great project!

<h3><a href="./Hangman" >Hangman App</a></h3>

<div>
  <p>
    The hangman App was difficult for me given the sessions. Both <a href="https://github.com/Carsonkitm">Carson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SophiaAHeatonWeberState">Sophia</a> worked hard on these sessions and got next to nowhere without help. Sophia is definitly our backend genius, on all of our assingments she has built up the entire backend for our projects. Carson did all of the frontend on the Hangman app, the picture looks great and the game functions well. Great effort by our team. I worked mostly on the sessions and helped out with the front and the back where my group needed extra help. Learned a lot this project.

  <p>
    This project demonstrated use of Node.js and Express. The troublesome part of this project was getting the other page to recognize and choose from input. Building the table and using cells to say if cell is the same as this print it out. Definitely challenging for me. Over all just backend and frontend route setting with some forms to publish.

<h3><a href="./HelloWorld" >Hello Mern</a></h3>

  <p>
    This was just a little intro to our groups! We were tasked with setting up a simple hello world REACT App to demonstrate github repositories and all the functions that git hub uses to share and commit changes to a shared project.

<div>
  <p>
    This Project was just using the browser extention RESTful API to test some of the backend functions like POST and GET. Just tested functionality and was a good demonstration for trouble shooting in the future. Overall no issues, not very challenging, learned a lot.
