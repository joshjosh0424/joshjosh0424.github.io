<h3><a href="./BankingApp" >Banking App</a></h3>

    This banking app does all the basic functions, withdrawing, transfers, depositing. It has a authentication system for login purposes. The hardest part in the assignment and most others was the sessions. Being able to store that ID and keep certain pages and information hidden depending on the ID was difficult. Took effort from everyone in the group to get that running. Overall the UI looks good, functions well, and was a great project!

<h3><a href="./Hangman" >Hangman App</a></h3>

    The hangman App was difficult for me given the sessions. Both <a href="https://github.com/Carsonkitm">Carson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SophiaAHeatonWeberState">Sophia</a> worked hard on these sessions and got next to nowhere without help. Sophia is definitly our backend genius, on all of our assingments she has built up the entire backend for our projects. Carson did all of the frontend on the Hangman app, the picture looks great and the game functions well. Great effort by our team. I worked mostly on the sessions and helped out with the front and the back where my group needed extra help. Learned a lot this project.

<h3><a href="./connect4" >Connect4 App</a></h3>

    This was another project similar to the hangman game where most of my time was spent on the game logic in the frontend. Simlarly to the rest of the projects in this repo it was all done with different stages of the MERN stack. This one was pretty straightforward. We followed a guide online as a class to get us introduced to the way that MERN can work. Although this didnt include Mongo or a backend.

<h3><a href="./mongo-e" >Mongo Introduction</a></h3>
<img width="1467" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 2 10 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f709059-9a08-43d7-839d-fba1128f05dd">

  <p>
    This project acted as a mongo db introduction. We used mongo and node routes to fetch different users which had different attributes such as name, position, level, etc... The main functionality was to be able to add, delete, and edit different users within the front end. Unfortunately, we deleted the mongo store, and i lost connection due to another student "owning" the db. However this is the what the frontend looked like.

<h3><a href="./ticTacToe" >ticTacToe</a></h3>
<img width="233" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 2 32 44 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b0a06ac-29a0-49bd-a9b6-0ee51de0a3a5">

<div>
  <p>
    This project like the connect4 is mainly focused on the frontend. Again i liked to work on the frontend game logic. One of the hurdles i had was working with states as i had not been exposed to this in any other class so far.
